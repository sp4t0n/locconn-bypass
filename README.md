# Python Web Scraping Script

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script for web scraping. The script uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape content from a specified URL, extract a specific link from a script tag, and print the bypassed link. This can be useful for various data extraction and web automation tasks.

## Prerequisites
